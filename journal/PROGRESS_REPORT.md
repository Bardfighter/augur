Progress report

We made plans on how we are going to change the front end of the augur application. Specifically, we analyzed various aspects of an 
existing application and made notes of ways the user interface can be iproved upon for ease of use and quality of life.
We noted that various aspects of the application are unexplianed in what they do, there's no apparent way add git groups or repositories,
there is no infor or help page, and certain links don't work while other times data deosn't load. 

For instance, stuff like adding/ searching for information on git groups and repositories may be something done in the command line, an inability
to make the user for the application know of a way to search for their pwn group is an aspect of the UI that can be added to.

As far as the project scope goes, since this is the first sprint, there isn't really any plans to alter our scope of altering hte UI to be more user friendly.

However, there were issues with getting the augur for to deploy, but that is detailed in the OBSTACLES document.
