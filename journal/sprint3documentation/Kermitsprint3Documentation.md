# Sprint 3 Documentation
## Kermit Kreder

For this sprint, I worked on two changes. I changed the page's title and I changed the search bar default text to be more clear. 
I started with the page title I decided to change the title statically so it is the same for every page as seen below.

This could dynamically be done by routing but as I was still investigating and getting used to the code I decided to start by just getting it changed statically.

The next change was to change the search bar default text as seen below.
![search bar picture](searchBar.png)
This was changed as before the default text telling you what to do was somewhat unclear and not as user friendly as it could be. 
I removed the astrisks and stated more clear what would be searched so that the user would have a better experience.
