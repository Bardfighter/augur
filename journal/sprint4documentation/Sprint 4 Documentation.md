Sprint 4 Documentation
==
**Darian:** For this sprint I developed a frontpage and rerouted everything else in order for this frontpage to be set up.
I also added another button on the error page that lets the user report a bug. One of the many issues I ran into was realizing 
that all the routing is done in the router.ts file and not the router.js file, but once I realized that the routing wasn't 
too difficult to fix and the front page wasn't too difficult to add in.

**Kermit:** For this sprint I created an about page that explains what Augur is and what each tab does. 
This gives the user information on what to expect and all the things they can do. This page was added to the side navbar 
and I used a material Icon that fits it. Additionally, I changed the logo in the top left to not clip below the insights tab box when on the page. 
This makes the website look cleaner overall. I had a bit of trouble with routing but once I figured out I had to use the default.vue to have access to the navbars, then it was easy.
